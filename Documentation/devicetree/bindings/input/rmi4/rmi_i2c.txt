Synaptics RMI4 I2C Device Binding

The Synaptics RMI4 core is able to support RMI4 devices using differnet
transports and differnet functions. This file describes the device tree
bindings for devices using the I2C tranport driver. Complete documentation
for other transports and functions cen be found ini
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/input/rmi4.

Required Properties:
- compatible: syna,rmi-i2c
- reg: I2C address
- #address-cells: Set to 1 to indicate that the function child nodes
		    consist of only on uint32 value.
- #size-cells: Set to 0 to indicate that the function child nodes do not
		have a size property.

Optional Properties:
- interrupts: interrupt which the rmi device is connected to.
- interrupt-parent: The interrupt controller.
See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/interrupt-controller/interrupts.txt

- syna,poll-interval-ms: The interval in milliseconds to wait between reading
			interrupts when the driver is polling.
- syna,reset-delay-ms: The number of milliseconds to wait after resetting the
			device.

- vdd-supply: VDD power supply.
See ../regulator/regulator.txt

- vio-supply: VIO power supply
See ../regulator/regulator.txt


Function Parameters:
Parameters specific to RMI functions are contained in child nodes of the rmi device
 node. Documentation for the parameters of each function can be found in:
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/input/rmi4/rmi_f*.txt.



Example:
	&i2c1 {
		rmi-i2c-dev@2c {
			compatible = "syna,rmi-i2c";
			reg = <0x2c>;
			#address-cells = <1>;
			#size-cells = <0>;
			interrupt-parent = <&gpio>;
			interrupts = <4 2>;

			rmi-f01@1 {
				reg = <0x1>;
				syna,nosleep-mode = <1>;
			};

			rmi-f11@11 {
				reg = <0x11>;
				syna,flip-y;
				syna,sensor-type = <2>;
			};
		};
	};

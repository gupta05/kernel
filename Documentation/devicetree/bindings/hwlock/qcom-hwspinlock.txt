Qualcomm Hardware Mutex Block:

The hardware block provides mutexes utilized between different processors
on the SoC as part of the communication protocol used by these processors.

- compatible:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <string>
	Definition: must be one of:
		    "qcom,sfpb-mutex",
		    "qcom,tcsr-mutex"

- reg:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
	Definition: base address and size of the mutex registers

- reg-names:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <string>
	Definition: must be "mutex-base"

- hwlock-base-id:
	Usage: optional
	Value type: <u32>
	Definition: base id of the hwlock device
		    (hwlock standard property, see hwlock.txt)

- #hwlock-cells:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <u32>
	Definition: must be 1, the specified cell represent the lock id
		    (hwlock standard property, see hwlock.txt)

- hwlock-num-locks:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <u32>
	Definition: the number of locks/mutex available in this block
		    (hwlock standard property, see hwlock.txt)

Example:

	hwlock@fd484000 {
		compatible = "qcom,tcsr-mutex";
		reg = <0xfd484000 0x1000>;
		reg-names = "mutex-base";

		hwlock-num-locks = <8>;
		#hwlock-cells = <1>;
	};

Qualcomm MSM Hardware Mutex Block:

The hardware block provides mutexes utilized between different processors
on the SoC as part of the communication protocol used by these processors.

- compatible:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <string>
	Definition: must be one of:
		    "qcom,sfpb-mutex",
		    "qcom,tcsr-mutex"

- reg:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
	Definition: base address and size of the mutex registers

- reg-names:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <string>
	Definition: must be "mutex-base"

- qcom,num-locks:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <u32>
	Definition: the number of locks/mutex available in this block

Example:

	hwlock@fd484000 {
		compatible = "qcom,tcsr-mutex";
		reg = <0xfd484000 0x1000>;
		reg-names = "mutex-base";
		qcom,num-locks = <32>;
	};

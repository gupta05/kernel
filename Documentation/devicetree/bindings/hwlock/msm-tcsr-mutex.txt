Qualcomm MSM Hardware Mutex Block:

The hardware block provides mutexes utilized between different processors
on the SoC as part of the communication protocol used by these processors.

Required properties:
- compatible: should be "qcom,tcsr-mutex"
- reg: Should contain registers location and length of mutex registers
- reg-names:
	"mutex-base"  - string to identify mutex registers
- qcom,num-locks: the number of locks/mutexes supported

Example:

	hwlock@fd484000 {
		compatible = "qcom,tcsr-mutex";
		reg = <0xfd484000 0x1000>;
		reg-names = "mutex-base";
		qcom,num-locks = <32>;
	};

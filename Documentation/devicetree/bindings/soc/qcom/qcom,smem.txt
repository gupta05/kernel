Qualcomm Shared Memory binding

This binding describes the Qualcomm Shared Memory, used to share data between
various subsystems and OSes in Qualcomm platforms.

- compatible:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <stringlist>
	Definition: must be:
		    "qcom,smem"

- reg:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
	Definition: base address and size pair for each area representing the
		    shared memory. The first pair will must represent the "main"
		    area, where the shared memory header and table-of-content
		    can be found.

- hwspinlocks:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
	Definition: reference to a hwspinlock used to protect allocations from
		    the shared memory

= EXAMPLE

        smem: smem@fa00000 {
                compatible = "qcom,smem";
                reg = <0x0fa00000 0x200000>,
                      <0xfc428000 0x4000>;

                hwlocks = <&tcsr_mutex 3>;
        };

Qualcomm Shared Memory binding

This binding describes the Qualcomm Shared Memory, used to share data between
various subsystems and OSes in Qualcomm platforms.

- compatible:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <stringlist>
	Definition: must be:
		    "qcom,smem"

- memory-region:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
	Definition: handle to memory reservation for main smem memory region.

- reg:
	Usage: optional
	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
	Definition: base address and size pair for any additional memory areas
		    of the shared memory.

- hwspinlocks:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
	Definition: reference to a hwspinlock used to protect allocations from
		    the shared memory

= EXAMPLE

	reserved-memory {
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <1>;
		ranges;

		smem_region: smem@fa00000 {
			reg = <0xfa00000 0x200000>;
			no-map;
		};
	};

	smem@fa00000 {
		compatible = "qcom,smem";

		memory-region = <&smem_region>;
		reg = <0xfc428000 0x4000>;

		hwlocks = <&tcsr_mutex 3>;
	};

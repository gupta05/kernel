Qualcomm PM8xxx LED connected to PWM

Required properties:
- compatible: should be "qcom,pm8xxx-pwm-led".
- reg: Address where the registers for the RGB LEDs are located

Each LED is represented as a sub-node of the pm8xxx pwm device.

LED sub-node required properties:
- pwms: PWM property pointing to the the PWM device according to the pwmchip
  implementation
  See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/pwm/pwm.txt
- qcom,id: One of "red", "green", or "blue" to specify which LED this is
  internally connected to.

LED sub-node optional properties:
- pwm-names: Name to be used by the PWM subsystem for the specifed PWMs
  See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/pwm/pwm.txt
- label: The label for this led
  See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/leds/common.txt
- linux,default-trigger: Default trigger assigned to the LED
  See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/leds/common.txt

Example:

pm8xxx_pwm: pm8xxx-pwm@b040 {
	compatible = "qcom,pm8xxx-pwm";
	#pwm-cells = <2>;
	...
};

pm8xxx-pwm-led@d000 {
	compatible = "qcom,pm8xxx-pwm-led";
	reg = <0xd000>;
	charger-led {
		label = "charger";
		pwms = <&pm8xxx_pwm 6 1000>;
		qcom,id = "red";
	};
};

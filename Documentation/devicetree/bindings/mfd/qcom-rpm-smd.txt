Qualcomm Resource Power Manager (RPM) over SMD

This driver is used to interface with the Resource Power Manager (RPM) found in
various Qualcomm platforms. The RPM allows each component in the system to vote
for state of the system resources, such as clocks, regulators and bus
frequencies.

- compatible:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <string>
	Definition: must be one of:
		    "qcom,rpm-msm8974"

- qcom,smd-channels:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <stringlist>
	Definition: Shared Memory Channel used for communication with the RPM

- #address-cells:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <u32>
	Definition: must be 1

- #size-cells:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <u32>
	Definition: must be 0

= SUBDEVICES

The RPM exposes resources to its subnodes. The below bindings specify the set
of valid subnodes that can operate on these resources.

== Switch-mode Power Supply regulator

- compatible:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <string>
	Definition: must be one of:
		    "qcom,rpm-pm8841-smps"
		    "qcom,rpm-pm8941-smps"


- reg:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <u32>
	Definition: resource as defined in <dt-bindings/mfd/qcom-rpm.h>
		    must be one of:
		    QCOM_RPM_PM8841_SMPS1 - QCOM_RPM_PM8841_SMPS4,
		    QCOM_RPM_PM8941_SMPS1 - QCOM_RPM_PM8941_SMPS3

Standard regulator bindings are used inside switch mode power supply subnodes.
Check Documentation/devicetree/bindings/regulator/regulator.txt for more
details.

== Low-dropout regulator

- compatible:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <string>
	Definition: must be one of:
		    "qcom,rpm-pm8941-ldo"

- reg:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <u32>
	Definition: resource as defined in <dt-bindings/mfd/qcom-rpm.h>
		    must be one of:
		    QCOM_RPM_PM8941_LDO1 - QCOM_RPM_PM8941_LDO24

Standard regulator bindings are used inside switch low-dropout regulator
subnodes.  Check Documentation/devicetree/bindings/regulator/regulator.txt for
more details.

== Switch

- compatible:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <string>
	Definition: must be one of:
		    "qcom,rpm-pm8941-switch"

- reg:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <u32>
	Definition: resource as defined in <dt-bindings/mfd/qcom/qcom-rpm.h>
		    must be one of:
		    QCOM_RPM_PM8941_LVS1 - QCOM_RPM_PM8941_LVS3,
		    QCOM_RPM_PM8941_MVS1 - QCOM_RPM_PM8941_MVS2

Standard regulator bindings are used inside switch regulator subnodes.  Check
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/regulator/regulator.txt for more details.

= EXAMPLE

	#include <dt-bindings/mfd/qcom-rpm.h>

	rpm@108000 {
		compatible = "qcom,rpm-msm8960";
		qcom,smd-channels = "rpm_requests";

		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;

		pm8941_s1: regulator-s1 {
			compatible = "qcom,rpm-pm8941-smps";
			reg = <QCOM_RPM_PM8941_SMPS1>;

			regulator-min-microvolt = <1300000>;
			regulator-max-microvolt = <1300000>;
		};

		pm8941_l3: pm8941-l3 {
			compatible = "qcom,rpm-pm8941-ldo";
			reg = <QCOM_RPM_PM8941_LDO3>;

			regulator-min-microvolt = <1200000>;
			regulator-max-microvolt = <1200000>;

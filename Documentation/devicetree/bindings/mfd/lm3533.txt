Texas Instruments LM3533 binding

This binding describes the Texas Instruments LM3533, a lighting power solution
for smartphone handsets. The common properties are described directly in the
node, while each individual component are described in an optional subnode.

- compatible:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <stringlist>
	Definition: must be:
		    "ti,lm3533"

	Value type: <u32>
	Definition: i2c address of the LM3533 chip

- als-supply:
	Usage: optional
	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
	Definition: reference to regulator powering the V_als input; as
		    specified in "../regulator/regulator.txt"

- hwen-gpios:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>

		    specified in "../gpio/gpio.txt"

- ti,boost-freq-hz:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <u32>
	Definition: switch-frequency of the boost converter, must be either:
		    500000 or 1000000

- ti,boost-ovp-mv:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <u32>
	Definition: over-voltage protection limit, in mV. Must be one of:
		    16000, 24000, 32000 or 40000

- #address-cells:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <u32>
	Definition: must be 1

= ALS SUBNODE
The ambient light sensor subnode must be named "als", it carries the light
sensor related properties.

- ti,als-resistance-ohm:
	Usage: required (unless ti,pwm-mode is specified)
	Value type: <u32>
	Definition: specifies the resistor value (R_als), in Ohm. Valid values
		    ranges from 200000 to 1574 Ohm.

- ti,pwm-mode:
	Usage: optional
	Value type: <empty>
	Definition: specifies, if present, that the als should operate in PWM
		    mode - rather than analog mode

= BACKLIGHT NODES
Backlight subnodes must be named "backlight", they carry the backlight related
properties.

- reg:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <u32>
	Definition: specifies which of the two backlights this node corresponds
		    to

- default-brightness:
	Usage: optional
	Value type: <32>
	Definition: specifies the default brightness for the backlight, in
		    units of brightness [0-255]

- label:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <string>
	Definition: specifies a name of this backlight

- led-max-microamp:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <u32>
	Definition: specifies the max current for this backlight, in uA, as
		    described in "../leds/common.txt"

- ti,pwm-zones:
	Usage: optional
	Value type: <u32 list>
	Definition: lists the ALS zones to be PWM controlled for this backlight,
		    the values in the list are in the range [0 - 4]

= LED NODES
LED subnodes must be named "led", they carry the LED related properties.

- reg:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <u32>
	Definition: specifies which of the four LEDs this node corresponds to

- linux,default-trigger:
	Usage: optional
	Value type: <string>
	Definition: specifies the default trigger for the LED, as described in
		    "../leds/common.txt"

- label:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <string>
	Definition: specifies a name of this LED, as described in
		    "../leds/common.txt"

- led-max-microamp:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <u32>
	Definition: specifies the max current for this LED, in uA, as described
		    in "../leds/common.txt"

- ti,pwm-zones:
	Usage: optional
	Value type: <u32 list>
	Definition: lists the ALS zones to be PWM controlled for this LED, the
		    values in the list are in the range [0 - 4]

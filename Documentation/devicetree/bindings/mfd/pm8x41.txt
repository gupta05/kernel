Qualcomm PM8841 and PM8941 PMIC multi-function devices

The PM8x41 PMICs are used with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 series SoCs, and are
interfaced to the chip via the SPMI (System Power Management Interface) bus.
Support for  multiple independent functions are implemented by splitting the
16-bit SPMI slave address space into 256 smaller fixed-size regions, 256 bytes
each.  A function can consume one or more of these fixed-size register regions.

Required properties:
- compatible: Must be one of:
     "qcom,pm8841"
     "qcom,pm8941"
- reg: Specifies the SPMI USID slave address for this device
- #address-cells = <1>
- #size-cells = <0>

Each child node represents a function of the PM8x41.  Each child 'reg' entry
describes an offset within the USID slave address where the region starts.

Example:

pm8941@0 {
	compatible = "qcom,pm8941";
	reg = <0x0>;

	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;

	rtc {
		compatible = "qcom,pm8941-rtc";
		reg = <0x6000 0x6100>;
	};
}
